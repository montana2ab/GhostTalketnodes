- ✅ Model conversion pattern works well
- ✅ SQLite provides excellent baseline performance
- ✅ Thread-safe design prevents race conditions

### What Could Be Improved
- ⚠️ SQLCipher should be implemented sooner (security priority)
- ⚠️ UI ViewModels should be updated immediately after storage
- ⚠️ Consider adding database backup/restore functionality
- ⚠️ Performance tests with realistic data volumes needed

### Recommendations
1. Prioritize SQLCipher implementation (security)
2. Test on real devices with large message volumes
3. Add database backup/restore for user data
4. Consider message search functionality early
5. Monitor database size growth in production

## Risk Assessment

### Completed Risks (Mitigated)
- ✅ **Storage implementation complexity**: Clean architecture made it manageable
- ✅ **Model inconsistencies**: Conversion helpers resolve differences
- ✅ **Thread safety**: Serial queue pattern ensures safety
- ✅ **Performance**: Benchmarks show good baseline performance

### Remaining Risks
- ⚠️ **SQLCipher integration**: Encryption key management complexity
- ⚠️ **Scale**: Performance with thousands of messages needs validation
- ⚠️ **Migration**: Future schema changes need careful testing
- ⚠️ **UI integration**: ViewModels need updates for persistence

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Test SQLCipher thoroughly with various key scenarios
2. Add pagination for large message lists
3. Implement robust migration testing
4. Update ViewModels incrementally with testing

## Timeline Impact
