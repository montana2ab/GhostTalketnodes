# GhostTalk Security Baseline Report

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security baseline for the GhostTalk ecosystem, including threat model, security controls, test results, and compliance measures.

**Security Posture**: Production-ready with comprehensive E2EE, metadata protection, and operational security controls.

## Threat Model

### Assets
1. **User Identity**: Session ID (public key) + private key
2. **Message Content**: Plaintext messages before/after E2EE
3. **Metadata**: Communication patterns, timing, social graph
4. **Service Node Keys**: Private keys for onion routing and mTLS
5. **Infrastructure**: Server systems, databases, backups

### Adversaries

#### 1. Passive Network Observer
- **Capability**: Observes network traffic (ISP, nation-state)
- **Goals**: Identify who talks to whom, when, how often
- **Mitigations**:
  - ✅ Onion routing (3+ hops)
  - ✅ TLS 1.3 encryption
  - ✅ Fixed-size packets (prevents size correlation)
  - ✅ Timing obfuscation (random delays)
  - ✅ Padding to fixed buckets

#### 2. Malicious Service Node Operator
- **Capability**: Controls one or more service nodes
- **Goals**: Decrypt messages, deanonymize users, disrupt service
- **Mitigations**:
  - ✅ End-to-end encryption (node sees only encrypted payload)
  - ✅ Onion routing (single node doesn't see full path)
  - ✅ K-replica swarms (no single node controls delivery)
  - ✅ mTLS + node signatures (prevent rogue nodes)
  - ✅ Rate limiting + PoW (prevent DoS)

#### 3. Device Compromise
- **Capability**: Physical or remote access to user device
- **Goals**: Extract keys, read messages, impersonate user
- **Mitigations**:
  - ✅ iOS Keychain with biometric protection
  - ✅ SQLCipher encrypted database
  - ✅ Forward secrecy (Double Ratchet) limits exposure
  - ✅ Secure deletion of temporary files
  - ⚠️ Cannot protect against jailbroken/rooted devices

#### 4. Law Enforcement / Government
- **Capability**: Legal demands for data, subpoenas, wiretaps
- **Goals**: Identify users, read messages, track communications
- **Mitigations**:
  - ✅ No user registration (no PII to subpoena)
  - ✅ E2EE prevents content access
  - ✅ Minimal logs (IPs retained < 24h)
  - ✅ Swarm storage encrypted (operator cannot read)
  - ⚠️ Metadata (IP, timing) may be observable at network level
  - ⚠️ Cannot prevent device seizure or key extraction

#### 5. Cryptanalytic Attack
- **Capability**: Break crypto through algorithmic weakness
- **Goals**: Decrypt messages, forge signatures
- **Mitigations**:
  - ✅ Industry-standard primitives (X25519, Ed25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
  - ✅ Proven protocols (Signal's X3DH + Double Ratchet)
  - ✅ Regular security audits
  - ⚠️ Quantum computers (future threat) → see post-quantum roadmap

## Security Controls

### Cryptography

#### 1. End-to-End Encryption

**X3DH Key Exchange**
- ✅ Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman (Signal specification)
- ✅ Forward secrecy from first message
- ✅ Deniability (no signatures on messages)
- ✅ Protection against key compromise impersonation (KCI)

**Double Ratchet**
- ✅ DH ratchet: ECDH per message (forward & backward secrecy)
- ✅ Symmetric ratchet: KDF chains for message keys
- ✅ Out-of-order delivery support
- ✅ Header encryption
- ✅ Deleted keys (no persistent message keys)

**Primitives**
```
Asymmetric:
  - Curve25519 (ECDH key exchange)
  - Ed25519 (signatures)

Symmetric:
  - ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD cipher)
  - HMAC-SHA256 (MACs)

Key Derivation:
  - HKDF-SHA256

Random Number Generation:
  - OS-provided CSPRNG (iOS: SecRandomCopyBytes, Linux: /dev/urandom)
```

#### 2. Onion Routing

**Sphinx-like Protocol**
- ✅ Layered encryption (each hop peels one layer)
- ✅ Forward secrecy (ephemeral keys per packet)
- ✅ Unlinkability (key blinding prevents packet correlation)
- ✅ Integrity protection (HMAC per hop)
- ✅ Replay protection (HMAC cache with TTL)

**Path Selection**
- ✅ Minimum 3 hops
- ✅ Avoid same node twice in path
- ✅ Prefer geographically diverse nodes
- ✅ Avoid nodes in same AS (autonomous system)

#### 3. Storage Security

**Client Storage (iOS)**
- ✅ SQLCipher: AES-256-CBC encrypted database
- ✅ iOS Keychain: Hardware-backed key storage (Secure Enclave on A12+)
- ✅ Biometric protection (Face ID / Touch ID)
- ✅ Data Protection API: Files encrypted at rest
- ✅ Secure deletion: Overwrite + unlink

**Server Storage**
- ✅ RocksDB with optional encryption at rest
- ✅ Encrypted backups (GPG)
- ✅ TTL enforcement (14 days default)
- ✅ No plaintext message storage (all E2EE encrypted)

### Network Security

#### 1. Transport Layer

**Client ↔ Node**
- ✅ TLS 1.3 only (no TLS 1.2 or below)
- ✅ Strong cipher suites (ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-GCM)
- ✅ Certificate pinning (public key pinning)
- ✅ HSTS with preload
- ✅ Perfect forward secrecy (ephemeral keys)

**Node ↔ Node**
- ✅ Mutual TLS (client cert authentication)
- ✅ Certificate validation (chain of trust)
- ✅ Cipher suite restriction (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- ✅ Certificate rotation (quarterly)

#### 2. Rate Limiting

**Per-IP Rate Limits**
```
- Bootstrap fetch: 10/minute
- Message submission: 100/minute
- Message retrieval: 100/minute
- Node registration: 1/hour
```

**Per-Session Rate Limits**
```
- Messages sent: 1000/day
- Attachments: 100/day
- Key bundles uploaded: 10/day
```

#### 3. Proof-of-Work (Anti-Spam)

**Hashcash-like PoW**
- ✅ Configurable difficulty (default: 20 bits)
- ✅ Required for message submission
- ✅ Difficulty adjusted based on load
- ✅ Validates on server side
- ⚠️ CPU-intensive on client (balanced for mobile)

```
PoW format:
  nonce = find_nonce(hash(message_id || timestamp || difficulty) < target)
  Client computes, server verifies in constant time
```

### Metadata Protection

#### 1. Timing Obfuscation

**Random Delays**
- ✅ Each hop adds 0-2s random delay
- ✅ Client sends dummy traffic (future enhancement)
- ✅ Batching at nodes (group messages in windows)

#### 2. Size Obfuscation

**Padding Strategy**
```
Message sizes padded to buckets:
  - Small: 512 bytes (text messages)
  - Medium: 4 KB (images)
  - Large: 64 KB (attachments)
  - XL: 1 MB (video/audio)
```

All packets padded to 1280 bytes (fits UDP, reduces fragmentation).

#### 3. Traffic Patterns

**Sealed Sender**
- ✅ Recipient address encrypted in onion layers
- ✅ Only final swarm node knows destination
- ✅ Sender identity not revealed to network

**Cover Traffic** (Future)
- ⚠️ Not implemented yet
- Roadmap: Client sends dummy messages to random nodes
- Goal: Obfuscate real communication patterns

### Operational Security

#### 1. Logging Policy

**What is Logged**
- ✅ Aggregate metrics (counts, latencies)
- ✅ Error events (with sanitized context)
- ✅ Admin actions (with signatures)
- ✅ Failed authentication attempts

**What is NOT Logged**
- ❌ Message content (never stored or logged)
- ❌ Session IDs (beyond necessary for routing)
- ❌ IP addresses (>24 hours retention)
- ❌ Packet payloads
- ❌ Social graph information

**Log Retention**
- Connection logs: 24 hours
- Error logs: 7 days
- Metrics: 30 days (aggregated)
- Audit logs: 1 year

#### 2. Access Control

**Node Access**
- ✅ SSH key-based authentication only (no passwords)
- ✅ Firewall rules (only required ports open)
- ✅ VPN or bastion required for admin access
- ✅ Principle of least privilege
- ✅ 2FA for admin console

**Database Access**
- ✅ Application-level credentials only
- ✅ No direct DB access from internet
- ✅ Encrypted connections (TLS)

#### 3. Sandboxing & Isolation

- ✅ seccomp-bpf (syscall filtering)
- ✅ User namespaces (non-root execution)
- ✅ Capability dropping (minimal caps)

**Container Security**
- ✅ Read-only root filesystem
- ✅ Non-root user (UID 1000)

- ✅ Resource limits (CPU, memory)

#### 4. Secrets Management

**Key Storage**
- ✅ Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for production keys (optional)
- ✅ Encrypted at rest (GPG, KMS)
- ✅ Key rotation every 90 days
- ✅ Key ceremony for CA keys (multi-party)
