## Known Issues

1. **Simplified crypto operations**: Some cryptographic operations (e.g., curve point operations) use simplified implementations. Need proper implementations for production.
2. **No persistent storage**: Currently using in-memory storage. RocksDB integration needed.
3. **No network replication**: Swarm replication framework in place but not fully implemented.
4. **BIP-39 wordlist incomplete**: Only example words included, need full 2048-word list.
5. **No rate limiting**: Framework in place but not enforced.

## Conclusion

The GhostTalk project has a solid foundation with:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive architecture and security documentation
- ‚úÖ Working Go server with core onion routing and swarm storage
- ‚úÖ iOS cryptographic engine with X3DH and Double Ratchet frameworks
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code templates for deployment
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building

**Overall Progress**: ~45% complete  
**Production Ready**: No (alpha stage)  
**Expected Beta**: 2-3 months  
**Expected Production**: 3-4 months

The project is on track for a successful launch. Major remaining work includes:
1. Completing iOS UI and network layers
2. Integration and E2E testing
3. Production deployment and monitoring
4. Security audit
5. Performance optimization
